# Linear Algebra 1 - Homework project / exercises

#### [My final solution in PDF for most of the assigned examples.](/abbandonate-ogni-speranza-voi-che-entrate-nell-algebra-lineare/PROJECT-Assignment-My_solutions/VAM_komb25-LA1_Ver2-my_final_solutions.pdf) Just FYI, I was supposed to develop exercises **version 2**.

#### Not relevant per se but [this PDF contains a bit of various other (often unfinished or half-finished) exercises I did during the autumn 2024](/abbandonate-ogni-speranza-voi-che-entrate-nell-algebra-lineare/PROJECT-Assignment-My_solutions/VAM_komb24-LA_various_unfinished_excercises/various_excercises-half-ok-half-not.pdf)

##### Here're the results of my playing and learning with R and matrices + RMarkdown + a use of Latex inside the .Rmd files + rendering the files, etc., etc. 

##### The content itself consists of solutions of some exercises I was assigned as my school homework project (above). The results came out **by utilizing R package `matlib`** which I accidentaly discovered. [The package](https://github.com/friendly/matlib) describes itself as *"Matrix Functions for Teaching and Learning Linear Algebra and Multivariate Statistics"* which is very adequate description.

##### **I didn't use the package for cheating!** I did my assignments by hand **with pencil and my brain only**. Yet, after that, **I just checked the results** whether I was correct. 

##### The reason why I put here the exercises computed by R is to prove my honesty (I arrived to the conclusions almost always in other way than R `matlib`'s algorithms). In that case anybody can check that I haven't used the computer for doing my own homework instead of me. Besides that, it was immense fun to play with the software:-) 

##### The PDF as well as HTML outputs of the exercises done by R and Rmarkdown are certainly not perfect. All the exercises obviously belong to the version 2:

* **exercise 1** - [PDF](/abbandonate-ogni-speranza-voi-che-entrate-nell-algebra-lineare/PROJECT-Assignment-My_solutions/VAM_komb24-LA_VER2_Exercises-checked_by_R/exercise1.pdf), [HTML](/abbandonate-ogni-speranza-voi-che-entrate-nell-algebra-lineare/PROJECT-Assignment-My_solutions/VAM_komb24-LA_VER2_Exercises-checked_by_R/exercise1.html)

# Abbandonate ogni speranza voi che entrate nell Algebra lineare.

Roughly "Abandon all hope, ye who enter linear algebra!" :-D It is a cheesy reminiscence on one of the most famous and well known passage of Dante Alighieri's renaissance masterpiece, La Divina Commedia.

In the most common ENG translation, it is  "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here". And it is written in the first main entrance (gate) to the hell when Dante's alter ego deseprately arrives there. IIRC this whole image should mainly express absolute hopelessness - that Dante won't be able to achieve what he want, that he will not find her only love eventually, that there's only despair inside the hell full of a unreformable sinners and so on. Just imagine Trump again in Capitol and you will get close:-P

## Anyway, the Linear algebra is not in any sensible sense near Dante's description of Hell. I just found it mildly funny and it is - at least - not just a common repo name.

So cheers and enjoy!
