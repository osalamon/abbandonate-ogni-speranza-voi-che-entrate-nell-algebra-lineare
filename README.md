# Abbandonate ogni speranza voi che entrate nell Algebra lineare.

Roughly "Abandon all hope, ye who enter linear algebra!" :-D It is a cheesy reminiscence on one of the most famous and well known passage of Dante Alighieri's renaissance masterpiece, La Divina Commedia.

In the most common ENG translation, it is  "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here". And it is written in the first main entrance (gate) to the hell when Dante's alter ego deseprately arrives there. IIRC this whole image should mainly express absolute hopelessness - that Dante won't be able to achieve what he want, that he will not find her only love eventually, that there's only despair inside the hell full of a unreformable sinners and so on. Just imagine Trump again in Capitol and you will get close:-P

## Anyway, the Linear algebra is not in any sensible sense near Dante's description of Hell. I just found it mildly funny and it is - at least - not just a common repo name.

So cheers and enjoy!
